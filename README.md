# AppleWatchAmmeter
Turn your Apple Watch into an ammeter to measure DC currents.

Apple Watches newer than Series 5 which contain a compass also contain a magnetometer. The magnetometer is alsos sensitive ot magnetic fields from nearby currents.

This demonstration uses a coil of wire around the watch to alter the magnetic field sensed.

An app could easily be written to perform some calibration and zero offset as well as display curent in Amperes.

In this demonstration, a 6-turn coil can easily show curent changes of about 10 mA.
